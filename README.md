A smart, modular, and real-time controlled energy system designed for Swedish winters combining PV, wind, gas turbine, and battery FMUs in Python.

## Introduction

In frigid countries like Sweden, heating can account for up to **70%** of residential energy demand â€” especially during winter. But fossil-fueled systems pose both environmental and economic concerns under volatile weather.

This project tackles that challenge by simulating a **smart hybrid renewable energy system** that ensures:

- Constant thermal output  
- Prioritization of renewables  
- Dynamic control using a Python-based co-simulation framework  

Each subsystem â€” PV, Wind, Battery, Gas Turbine, Heater, Controller â€” is modeled in **OpenModelica**, exported as **FMUs**, and integrated in **Python** through real-time orchestration logic.

> **The result?** A smart, reactive microgrid that thinks, adapts, and heats efficiently.

## Objectives

-  Maintain **363.5 K** outlet temperature at all times  
-  Prioritize **renewable energy** (PV + Wind)  
-  Use **battery storage** to absorb surplus and supply deficit  
-  Activate **gas turbine** only when necessary  
-  Export to **grid** only when storage is full  

## System Overview

### Components

-  **PV FMU** â€“ generates electricity based on irradiance  
-  **Wind Turbine FMU** â€“ Complements solar generation by converting wind speed into electrical power
-  **Battery FMU** â€“ Stores excess renewable energy and provides power during shortages
-  **Gas Turbine FMU** â€“ dispatchable power & heat with efficiency recovery  
-  **Heater FMU** â€“ uses electricity + recovered heat to heat water  
-  **Supervisory Controller FMU** â€“ smart logic to dispatch power and balance constraints

### Simulation Context

-  Realistic **3-day Swedish winter** with sunny, rainy, and snowy periods  
-  Inputs: 15-min interval irradiance, wind speed, ambient & water temperatures  
-  Time step: **900 seconds**

##  How It Works
1.  The system components are modelled on open-modellica and saved as FMU files
2. All FMUs are instantiated via a Python wrapper
3. `project.py` imports component models from `myFMU` and reads data from `data.csv` 
4. Every 15-minute interval:
   - PV & Wind generate power based on weather data
   - Controller decides:
     - Gas Turbine output
     - Battery charge/discharge within SOC constraints are met
     - Grid export logic
     - Balancing renewable generation, battery use, and gas turbine support to meet heater demand
   - Heater uses power to heat water to desired temperature while respecting limits
5. Data stored in `results.csv`
6. `plottedfigures.py` generates insightful plots

## Plots & Analytics

By running `plottedfigures.py`, the following results were obtained:

| **Figure** | **Description** |
